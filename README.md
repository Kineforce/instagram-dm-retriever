# instagram-dm-retriever
I built this python script to explore how Instagram fetch their data on Direct Messages app
# how to use it
just install python3 on your machine and execute:
<code>python3 main.py</code>
# todo
currently, i'm using an auth-cookie and the instagram app id parameters from requests made by the web app of Instagram,
it needs to automate this, perhaps insert user and password, make authentication, and retrieve these tokens automatically
